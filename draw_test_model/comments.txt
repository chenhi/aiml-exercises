Some comments on digits:
* These models are still really bad when the digit is zoomed, or translated, or rotated.
** Applying some random transformations to the training data helped a lot with this.  It still gets 4/9, 0/6 confused a bit, especially when small.
* I thickened the brush and it improved the results, so probably the model is also sensitive to thickness.
** Haven't tested this much more.



Some comments on fashion:
* My drawings of various articles of clothing are cartoons of cartoons, so probably not a good way to evaluate the model.



Todo:
* Have the web app save images for usage in testing later
*
