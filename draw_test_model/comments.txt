Some comments on digits:

* These models are still really bad when the digit is zoomed, or translated, or rotated.
** Applying some random transformations to the training data helped a lot with this.  It still gets 4/9, 0/6 confused a bit, especially when small.

* I thickened the brush and it improved the results, so probably the model is also sensitive to thickness.
** Haven't tested this much more.
** I noticed the saved images look a little too transparent.  Maybe they need to be darkened?  Darkening them a little bit.


Some comments on fashion:
* My drawings of various articles of clothing are cartoons of cartoons, so probably not a good way to evaluate the model.



Todo:
* Have a way to re-test the models on the saved images en masse
