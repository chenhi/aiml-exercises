Some comments on digits:
* These models are still really bad when the digit is zoomed, or translated, or rotated.
* I thickened the brush and it improved the results, so probably the model is also sensitive to thickness.

Some comments on fashion:
* My drawings of various articles of clothing are cartoons of cartoons, so probably not a good way to evaluate the model.
