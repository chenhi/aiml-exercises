Me doing a first exercise in training neural networks with an interface for "real life" testing (i.e. draw it yourself).

You can use it to play with your own models.  You need to create directories: models/ and static/savedtests/

app.yaml, main.py are just for deploying to Google Cloud and can be ignored.
