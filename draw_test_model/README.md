Me doing a first exercise in training neural networks with an interface for "real life" testing (i.e. draw it yourself).

No longer including models in the repo, too many of them now.

app.yaml, main.py are just for deploying to Google Cloud and can be ignored.

You need to create directories: models/ and savedtests/
