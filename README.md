# aiml-exercises
Some machine learning exercises.  See:
+ [Experiments on a Q-learning toy example](https://github.com/chenhi/aiml-exercises/tree/main/game_learner/ttt)


Learning goals:

draw_tensor_model:
* Learn to build a Flask app.
* Build some basic AI models using MNIST data.
* Have an interface for testing and tweaking the models using spontaneously created data.
* TODO: Try to get accuracy above 99.9%

game_learner:
* Write some general classes for training an AI to play games using Q learning. (done)
* Train a bot to play tic-tac-toe using Q learning and experiment with hyperparameters.
* Train a bot to play Connect 4 using deep Q learning (partially trained on the cloud).
* TODO: Do the same but with Monte Carlo search trees.

tensor_puzzles:
* Learn how to broadcast with numpy arrays.

gpu_puzzles:
* Learn the basics about GPU programming.
